# TicTacToeJava
2-player Tic Tac Toe game
Plan on:
  making classes(Board class for board state, Game class to handle all the methods)
  tidying/altering code to flow better
  making better logical statements
  changing things like .equals() instead of == for String comparison
  possible interactive GUI
